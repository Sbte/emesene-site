In this way the offline people are at the bottom, you can hide them unchecking "show offline", and there you go, "collapsed" offline group :D.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Open downloaded files with double click</span><br /><br />seems reasonable :D<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Qt front end</span><br /><br />I don't know Qt, I would like to learn it, and trying to make a Qt front end seems like a nice excuse to me ;), but for now I will focus on the base and the gtk front end.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Donate now" on Help</span><br /><br />Nice idea, I got a donation only once, $10 from C10uD (thanks!, I will get that money and buy a beer sometime :D)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Get themes/plugins from a repository</span><br /><br />I will add that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modify global configuration and inherit for new accounts</span><br /><br />already done on emesene 2 :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save conversation on invisible mode</span><br /><br />I will remember that :D<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide blocked contacts (that is what I understood)</span><br /><br />nice feature!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Resize large emoticons</span><br /><br />I will try to remember it when p2p is implemented<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lower cpu usage with to many custom emoticons</span><br /><br />animating a gif uses a lot of CPU I will see what can I do.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">ugly maximized login window</span><br /><br />on version 1 or 2?<br /><br />what could be done to make it less ugly?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">import/export logs</span><br /><br />yep<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">search logs by client</span><br /><br />ok..<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom group sort</span><br /><br />will see if I can implement it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Better support for self on contact list</span><br /><br />yep<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Drag and drop for display picture</span><br /><br />I need to implement p2p before but yes ;)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclaimer:</span> Some of those requests are for features that are not implemented yet and will take a long time to be implemented, so please you will have to make me remember if I don't implement them
