this week i started to study so the project got a small gap, but today i had some time and i fixed and closed all the bugs in the tracker (11) , so please check out the latest version and keep testing.<br /><br />of course i know that there are some more bugs but its easier to fix bugs that are described and have a traceback so please use the tracker.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
