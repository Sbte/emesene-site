This weekend I had some time to code, so I implemented the invite dialog and finished the display of emoticons on the input field. Some modifications were made on the code to allow extensions on other toolkits too.<br />Dx made some small gui tweaks and worked on p2p, so we may have p2p working on some time.<br /><br />With the invite dialog the conversation window is almost done, the only thing left is custom emoticon and display picture that depends on p2p.<br /><br />a screenshot of the gui with the invite window:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/ShnwXZJHTvI/AAAAAAAAGM0/KnSyyCZKtRk/s1600-h/mesinyer-add.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 179px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/ShnwXZJHTvI/AAAAAAAAGM0/KnSyyCZKtRk/s320/mesinyer-add.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339563117901205234" border="0" /></a>
