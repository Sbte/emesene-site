I have been refactoring the code of mesinyer since the start of the week, I've moved a lot of code, I've rewritten all the code for menues and toolbars to support the new extension framework.<br />The code now is more modular, separated and allows to replace any part of the gui with a custom part (an example of that when all the work is done).<br /><br />what is the visible difference between the code from last week?<br />If you use it you will note no difference (I hope :D), since refactoring is about enhancing the code without modifying functionality.<br /><br />This post is just to let you know that a lot of work is being made on the project, and if you don't see it on the gui/functionality it's because we are setting up everything to make mesinyer the most extensible/cusomizable IM client around :D.<br /><br />some news:<br /><br />* roger is working on Offline messages for mesinyer<br />* dx is working on p2p for mesinyer<br />* C10ud is evaluating some patches to be added to emesene 1.x<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
