some people are asking when the first alpha/beta/something will be, to answer those questions I made this post.<br /><br />The idea of the first "something" officially for emesene 2 will be when I get to the following milestone:<br /><br />"emesene 2 is everything I want except P2P"<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">what that means? </span><br /><br />that the first public bundle to test will be made when I have emesene feature complete excluding P2P (custom emoticons, file send/receive, webcam and inks). When that release is made I will receive bug reports on some place (trac is really not used right now, at least by me), I will work to fix all the problems that appear on that release, then I will make a new release when I think that all major bugs are removed, I will make a new cycle fixing bugs.<br /> When those two cycles are finished we should have something like:<br /><br />"emesene 2 is everything people want except P2P and it's stable"<br /><br />then if dx is still not working on P2P (*looks at dx*) I will start to work on that, the features will be added in this order:<br /><ul><li>display pictures</li><li>custom emoticons</li><li>file send/receive</li></ul>then I will make a release to test those implementations and fix bugs. After fixing the bugs the first release of emesene 2 will be made, a next cycle of bugfixing will be made and after that we will start to work on webcam.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">why webcam at the end?</span><br /><br />because webcam is unstable, it breaks, different distributions/operative systems handle webcam in a different ways, it breaks, it needs to compile/have a shared library, it breaks... did I said it breaks? ;)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">dates for that milestones?</span><br /><br />No idea, pretty busy right now trying to finish my engineer career and working, but I really want to get to the first milestone fast. Right now the things missing are<br /><br /><ul><li>display emoticons on userlist/labels</li><li>plugin preference dialog</li><li>finish emoticon handling on conversation input</li><li>theme handling on preferences</li><li>finish the information view for logs</li></ul>if you want to test earlier, you can checkout from tne subversion repository :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
