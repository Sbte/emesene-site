I implemented sound notifications for emesene, also moved all the notification code to a method that will allow to change debug settings on the fly and not to restart emesene, also you will be able to see the debug on a window or dump it to a file. Also proxy, http method and proxy authentication implemented on e3 and yabber and integrated with the config dialog, so now you can use emesene 2 with those settings.<br /><br />If you have a proxy/proxy with authentication, please test it and report bugs.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
