Hello fellow emeseners, this is syst3m. Most of you don't know me, and  if you do that scares me a bit.<br /><br />Anyways, if you are a Windows emesene  user then you are probably familiar with some of my work. I am the guy  that has been making the installers (and portable versions) of emesene  since just before the release of 2.11.4.<br /><br />Now for the real reason for this post.<br /><br />There will be a new installer  in 2.11.6!<br /><br />I know it might not sound too exciting, but a lot of  improvements have already been made to the installer to make it more  user-friendly and Windows-friendly.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mTVeXNMz21I/Te-cxTiGvDI/AAAAAAAAJHM/wRylw5DvziQ/s1600/emesene-installer-1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="248" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mTVeXNMz21I/Te-cxTiGvDI/AAAAAAAAJHM/wRylw5DvziQ/s320/emesene-installer-1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Some of the new features did make it  into 2.11.5, but those were just added on to the existing boring  installer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0NfyGlrHkmA/Te-cx9qZqjI/AAAAAAAAJHQ/XR4x3vtNjGA/s1600/emesene-installer-2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="248" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0NfyGlrHkmA/Te-cx9qZqjI/AAAAAAAAJHQ/XR4x3vtNjGA/s320/emesene-installer-2.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />emesene 2.11.6 features a completely re-written installer  (and portable) script which include some new features as well as some  improvements to existing ones.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5N0yYD0arYY/Te-cyvcHXCI/AAAAAAAAJHU/sIoxM9k6mfU/s1600/emesene-installer-3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5N0yYD0arYY/Te-cyvcHXCI/AAAAAAAAJHU/sIoxM9k6mfU/s320/emesene-installer-3.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="im"><br /><br />Current Features:</div><div class="im"></div><div class="im"><ul><li>Modern UI</li><li>Multi-language support</li><li>Added license, components, directory, welcome and finish pages</li><li>Clean uninstallation (registry friendly)</li><ul><li>Optionally cleans up any older registry files</li><li>Optionally deletes config (current user only)</li></ul><li>Checks if emesene is running when installer or uninstaller is opened</li><li>Added uninstall information to Add/Remove Programs</li><li>Ability to remove StartMenu Shortcuts</li><li>  Slightly better compression (smaller installer size)</li></ul></div><br />Planned Features:<ul><li>Check installed version upon new installation</li></ul><br />Other  Windows changes that are present in 2.11.5 and newer are that shortcut  icons now works in Windows Vista/7 and the config folder has been moved  to APPDATA<br />(C:\Documents and Settings\{username}\Application Data on XP and<br />C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming on Vista/7).<br /><br />Sorry for any inconvenience in moving of the config file.<br /><div id=":1hs">  <br />Before I go I just wanted to let you the users know that it is not  hard to make contributions to emesene.</div><div id=":1hs">&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs"> You don't have to be a developer  or packager to help out, though they do help.&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">It's as simple as  submitting bugs, suggestions, and translating into a language you know.&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">I  started with minimal knowledge of python (still don't know much) but  that didn't stop me from helping.<br /><br />If you're interested in trying out windows experimental/development  packages to try out new features, bug fixes, and my lovely new installer  you have options.&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">You can build your own packages using <a href="http://blog.emesene.org/2011/03/rough-guide-to-create-windows-packages.html" target="_blank">http://blog.emesene.org/2011/<wbr></wbr>03/rough-guide-to-create-<wbr></wbr>windows-packages.html</a> and compiling using "emesene-installer-MUI.nsi" OR you can user pre-built packages made by yours truly at <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/emesene" target="_blank">http://www.mediafire.com/<wbr></wbr>emesene</a><br /><br />Remember anything that is not a stable release should not be considered stable, and may include issues.<br /><br />Bye for now. :)<br /><br />- syst3m</div><div id=":1hs"><br /></div><div id=":1hs">marianoguerra: a huge round of welcome applauses for our new windows packaging overlord syst3m!&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">&nbsp;</div><div id=":1hs">(want to become our packaging overlord for other OS/distribution? join us at github and/or the mailing list and ask!)</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
