hi!<br /><br />for some time users have been asking where was the forum and which was the replacemente for the forum.<br /><br />since maintaining all the infrastructure by ourselves was taking a lot of times for the contributors of the project and we had several "entry points" to the project we decided to consolidate.<br /><br />the result is the blog as a place to be up to date on what's happening with the project, get information, downloads, links etc.<br /><br />and github for development, issue tracker, wiki etc.<br /><br />all this is working really nice, except for the fact that there is no place for end users to interact with eachother.<br /><br />after some discussion we decided to open the emesene users group on google groups<br /><br />the idea of the group is to discuss/share things like plugins/themes and maybe small problems/fixes/workarounds.<br /><br />we would also like to use that channel as a way to expose tasks that don't require lot of expertise, like translations, documentation, small bug fixes, improvement on code quality etc.<br /><br />the rules are simple:<br /><br /><ul><li>the channel is to talk about emesene, stay on topic</li><ul><li>mark [OT] on the subject if you really think an off topic post should go to the list, to make it easy for people to filter those messages</li></ul><li>english is preferred, that way we reach more people</li><ul><li>if you really don't know anything about english mark your topic with the language ([es], [it], [pr]) so other people can filter those topics</li></ul><li>be nice</li><li>help move common knowledge to the wiki or to a FAQ to point repeated questions there</li><li>help us promote interested people to developers</li></ul><br />so, come over and let's talk about emesene<br /><br /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/emesene">http://groups.google.com/group/emesene</a><br /><br />this is all for now, I may expand this post as we go
