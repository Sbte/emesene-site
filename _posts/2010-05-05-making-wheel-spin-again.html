hi! remember me? remember this project?<br /><br />well, I've been busy lately (now I'm an engineer :) and this days I started using emesene 2 with the jabber backend so I force myself to fix bugs and improve it.<br /> I started fixing some bugs but I noted that the project was a little stalled on github.<br /><br />As any project we can't depend on the time or willing to code of one person (not just me, I'm taling about cloud, cando, and all the other people that help regularly), so we need to get more people willing to help us making emesene 2 the best IM client around.<br /><br />That means that if you can try it, test it, find bugs and hopefully fix them, then you should, and if you want to go an extra mile, please talk about this project wherever you can so we may reach people willing to help us.<br /><br />right now I fixed some bugs regarding adium themes, loading preferences and extensions, an exception while connection to jabber and some smaller ones. But we can't depend on one coder so if you are willing to help, then jump on board.<br /><br />any question you have on how to collaborate, leave a comment or go to the forum and make some noise about emesene 2.
