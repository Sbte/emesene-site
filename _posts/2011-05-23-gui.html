<b>Gabriele "Whisky" Visconti</b> a while ago started writing a <b>Qt4</b> gui extension for emesene (yes, through our nifty extensions it is actually possible to support multiple gui toolkits) and today i'm here to say that i put his great work into emesene/master so that all our git users can try it and maybe improve it/help him fix stuff!<br /><br />Actually, launching emesene with the <b>Qt4</b> gui is <i>really</i> easy:<br />- install pyqt (debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-qt4)<br />- get a copy of emesene from git (so you'll be updated enough)<br />- run emesene: emesene -e main:qt4_main<br /><br />Beware! This code is still a draft far behind the GTK+ one but it's a great start if you like Qt..and emesene of course (hint: almost-native look in every plaform anyone?). It is not meant for everyday use (yet?), but hacking on it should be real fun.<br /><br />What are you waiting for? Just pull and updated copy of emesene-git and start hacking!
