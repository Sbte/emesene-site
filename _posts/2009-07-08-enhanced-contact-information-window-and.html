Today I had some free time so I continued working on the Contact Information window that was left behind some time ago to code some features.<br /> I enhanced the layout, the output of the chat history and added a new feature that a lot of people requested: saving the logs to plain text.<br /><br />Still needs some work to do but the basics are there, on the feature I would like to add support to save to HTML and to export logs between two dates.<br /><br />here is a screencast of the features:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZcSF3liEdMs&hl=es&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZcSF3liEdMs&hl=es&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
