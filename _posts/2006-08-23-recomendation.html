Since the code for the conversations have been rewrited 100% i have found that it have a lot of bugs, when i make the release i only tested the multichat and it worked very well but it have a lot of problems with single conversations.<br /><br />I suggest you to downgrade to 0.1.5 untill i make a new release.<br /><br />sorry by the problems...<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/vol6/no20/bugs.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/vol6/no20/bugs.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
