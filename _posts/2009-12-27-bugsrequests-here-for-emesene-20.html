Since I need some hints on where to work on emesene 2.0 I want you to post feature requests and bug reports here:<br /><br /><a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene/issues">http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene/issues</a><br /><br />we had troubles with trac and redmine lately so I want something easy and not on our servers. We will see how it works.<br /><br />please check if the bug/request is already there to avoid duplication (I have to work when someone makes a duplicate request, so less time coding :D)
