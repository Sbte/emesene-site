now that you have instructions on how to build installer and portable versions of emesene 2, I expect the best and most tested installer available in short time.<br /><br />you asked for it, now you have it, make windows a first class citizen for emesene 2.<br /><br />test it, fix the problems and provide up to date versions of emesene for your platform.<br /><br />linux, *BSD users: what are you waiting to document how to package for your distro of choice and be at the level of windows?<br /><br />if you have the steps documented, contact me so we can add them to the emesene repo and keep the updated versions where users can see them.<br /><br />happy packaging!
