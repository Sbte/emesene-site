if you want to help but you don't want to learn about emesene structure and know some python and SQL then you can help.<br /><br />build a script that imports the logs from emesene 1 SQLite schema to the schema in emesene 2 SQLite log format.<br /><br />this would be really helpful and may help some people to migrate to emesene 2.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
