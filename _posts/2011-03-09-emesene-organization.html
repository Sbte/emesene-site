some organization news.<br /><br />I created 4 new repositories in emesene organization at github, those repositories are:<br /><br /><ul><li>emesene supported plugins</li><li>emesene community plugins</li><li>emesene supported themes</li><li>emesene community themes</li></ul><br />you can see them here: <a href="https://github.com/emesene">https://github.com/emesene</a><br /><br />the idea is to separate the repositories that contain plugins and themes from the main emesene repo so changes in that repo are only code related and related to emesene.<br /><br />this also gives a place where plugin and theme developers can join and discuss things using git's wiki and issue tracker.<br /><br />the idea is to have a a set of really useful and well maintained plugins and themes in the supported repos but also have a more "liberal" repository where new themes and plugins can be submitted and people can discuss around them.<br /><br />I will be moving the themes and plugins from emesene to the correspondent repos in the following days.<br /><br />come over and help us!
