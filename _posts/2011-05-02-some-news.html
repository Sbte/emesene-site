the consolidation of the sites is finished:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://forum.emesene.org/">forum.emesene.org</a> points to <a href="https://github.com/emesene/emesene/issues">https://github.com/emesene/emesene/issues</a></li><li><a href="http://emesene.org/">emesene.org</a> points to <a href="http://blog.emesene.org/">blog.emesene.org</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.emesene.org/">blog.emesene.org</a> is the same as <a href="http://emesene-msn.blogspot.com/">emesene-msn.blogspot.com</a></li></ul><br /><a href="http://emesene.org/">emesene.org</a> doesn't exist anymore, all the content of the site is moved to the tabs you see above<br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_140764021"><br /></a><br /><a href="http://forum.emesene.org/">forum.emesene.org</a> was disabled since it was full of spam and google was threatening me to disable my google account because of the pr0n<br /><br />about emesene 2 and some complaints:<br /><br /><ul><li> yes, we know emesene 2.11.4 is a little rough around the edges, but we needed to make a release to reach a wider audience, get more feedback and hopefully more developers (help us!)</li><li>emesene 1 won't come back, anyone who wants to keep it alive may fork it but we encourage you to make emesene 2 as good (and better) than emesene 1, after all emesene 1.6.3 was a result of years of polishing, give emesene 2 a go and help us reach that level, I'm sure it will become better than that in the following months. Don't waste energy on two projects when we can focus on the latest version.</li><li>we still need packagers! the main reasons of instability are package related, help us get great packages to avoid wasting energy on things that are not related to emesene's code.</li><li>saying that it sucks, or that you will switch to other client if we don't do what you want doesn't help a lot, please help us by recruiting more developers and that way the problems will solve quicker and you will eventually get what you want</li></ul>and finally many thanks to the people that made this release posible, in order of contributions:<br /><br /><ul><li>Riccardo (C10uD)</li><li>Mariano Guerra</li><li>cando</li><li>arielj</li><li>4ndreaSt4gi</li><li>Davide Lo Re</li><li>Sven (Sbte)</li><li>karasu</li><li>dequis (dx)</li><li>Jose Rostagno</li><li>SWOriginal</li><li>Hung-Yen Chen</li><li>nenemfromhell</li><li>hammered</li><li>Richard Somlói</li><li>j0hn (j0hn soplete)</li><li>Ivan25</li><li>André Lopes</li><li>Adolfo Fitoria</li><li>ariel</li><li>xisco</li><li>WayneSan</li><li>Otacon</li></ul>
