>>> def itsimportant(thing):<br />...     print "why isn't", thing, "implemented, it's really important"<br />...<br />>>> [itsimportant(x) for x in ["video", "audio", "backgrounds", "games"]]<br />why isn't video implemented, it's really important<br />why isn't audio implemented, it's really important<br />why isn't backgrounds implemented, it's really important<br />why isn't games implemented, it's really important<br /><br />We know there are features not implemented, we know you think they are pretty basic and they should be available for emesene to be a "serious" project.<br /><br />But as you may know, we develop emesene because we like to, in our free time, for free, so when we can we try to implement the basic things missing and improve the project.<br /><br />all multimedia stuff is really hard and platform dependent so even when emesene 1.6 has video support we get a lot of "my webcam doesn't work", "it's slow", "why not audio" etc.<br /><br />Not only is hard, it also breaks with new versions, so all your time invested goes through the window when MS thinks it's fun t break everything. See <a href="http://kakaroto.homelinux.net/2010/03/amsn-0-98-2-to-be-released-without-audiovideo-support/">here</a> for more information.<br /><br />if you can help in any way then do it, but please understand that we know what is missing and that is important. <br /><br />saying things like "I would use emesene if it has X" won't make us run and implement it, because our time is limited and we don't like that kind of pressure.<br /><br />we try to make emesene awesome, if you think emesene could be better then you can hire the main developers, they will work full time and will have to implement that features because that is what they are paid for ;)<br /><br />one last so you understand: I don't even use the msn network since 2 years ago, so I'm not even developing something I use (I use emesene 2 with the jabber support only). So I'm developing features that I won't use just for you to have a nice alternative to MSN on linux. This should give you an idea of how much we like emesene to be awesome, even when I don't use almost all the features it has.
