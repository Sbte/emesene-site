I'm back!<br /><br />this days I made a huge refactoring moving code around to make it easier to manage and navigate, yo can check the changes on github.<br /><br />since refactoring aren't cool to end users since they don't change anything on the surface (I hope), I implemented cache support for avatars and custom emoticons, and also the support for avatars on the gui, this means that once we have p2p support on e3 (dx I'm looking at you) the gui will be there to use it since day one. it also mean that other protocol back-ends can start using it right now (some people are working on a papyon back-end, isn't e3 cool? :P).<br /><br />I also added two extensions, avatar chooser (to manage and change your avatar), and image chooser (to choose an image from the file system), both where forward ported from emesene 1 with some code cleanup.<br /><br />I also added the code needed to update the gui in case of a avatar change.<br /><br />less words and more screencasts!<br /><br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/aRoQOq8NQOo&amp;hl=es&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/aRoQOq8NQOo&amp;hl=es&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="344" width="425"></embed></object><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
