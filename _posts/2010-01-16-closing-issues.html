I added the "No group" to group all the users that are not in a group (duh!).<br /><br />I added the option to group all the offline users inside a special group.<br /><br />Also added Ctrl+Esc and Ctrl+Tab shortcuts on the conversation window.<br /><br />thanks to cando who started contributing code.<br /><br />Now start testing and contributing!
