Some people is asking where is emesene 2 code available.<br /><br />well, it's not on svn like emesene 1.x, since the start of emesene 2 we are using git and the code is located at github.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">what is git?</span><br /><br />simply explained it's a distributed version control system, that means that it allows people having their own repositories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">why would you want that?</span><br /><br />anyone that want's to start coding something new can "clone" (copy) a repository and start working on it doing local commits and pushes, people can watch the repository, get the code, test it play with it and even clone it. When it's done this user can ask other programmers to "pull" (get) his code into their repositories. That makes the main repository stable and allow people to try new things and show them.<br /><br />imagine also that I go crazy and start to port emesene 2 to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29">whitespace</a>, people can clone the latest sane version of emesene and keep coding from there.<br /><br />also, you can follow experimental branches if you want, or clone the code to play with it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">why git?</span><br /><br />I made a poll some time ago and git won :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">so where is the code?</span><br /><br />the main repositories are mine and the on from boyska and dxdx they are here:<br /><br /><a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene">http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene</a><br /><a href="http://github.com/boyska/emesene">http://github.com/boyska/emesene</a><br /><a href="http://github.com/dequis/emesene">http://github.com/dequis/emesene</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">nice, how do I *really* get the code?</span><br /><br />you can click the download button or you can clone the repository using git<br /><br />firts install it:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">sudo aptitude install git-core</span><br /><br />or similar for other distros..<br /><br />then clone the repo<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">git clone git://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene.git</span><br /><br />you can update periodically doing<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">git pull</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">edit:</span><br /><br />I fixed the problem appearing when papyon wasn't installed, if it's not available the papyon extension will be disabled, try cloning again my repo or updating it.<br /><br />if you want the papyon extension (to see display pictures) you will have to install it from here:<br /><br /><a href="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/31746931/python-papyon_0.4.2-1%7Eppa9.04%2B1_all.deb">http://launchpadlibrarian.net/31746931/python-papyon_0.4.2-1%7Eppa9.04%2B1_all.deb</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
