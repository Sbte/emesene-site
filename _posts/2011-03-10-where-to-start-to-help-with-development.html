hi!<br /><br />this is a small guide for people that want to start helping us in emesene 2.<br /><br />the idea of this guide is to start with small tasks until you feel confident with the code base.<br /><br />first read the description of the project here:<br /><br /><a href="http://emesene.org/docs/">http://emesene.org/docs/</a><br /><br />then read PEP8, the python coding style guide we follow: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a><br /><br />then install pylint on your computer and all the tools needed to code (a text editor, git etc.)<br /><br />the configure your editor to replace tabs to 4 spaces, this is important.<br /><br />then you can do two things:<br /><br /><ul><li>go to the issue tracker and look for an easy ticket, and try to fix it</li><li>start running pylint on modules and fixing the warnings and error that appears*</li></ul>if you have any doubt you can subscribe to the developers mailing list here: <a href="http://lists.emesene.org/listinfo.cgi">http://lists.emesene.org/listinfo.cgi </a><br /><br />when you start developing you should create a github account, fork emesene/emesene from here <a href="https://github.com/emesene/emesene">https://github.com/emesene/emesene</a> make the changes and make a pull request.<br /><br />if you want to be ordered you could create a branch for each improvement, do a pull request of that branch and when accepted, merge the branch to master.<br /><br />this is not needed but if you want to improve your git skills this workflow can help you<br /><br />I hope this helps, if you have any doubt post a comment, I will update this post if some questions are useful for all.<br /><br />* pylint reports some errors that are not in fact errors, you will learn to recognize them after some time.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
