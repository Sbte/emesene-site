This is the first guest post in this blog written by Andrea, a new developer that is doing awesome contributions to the project, let's give him a round of aplausses and some recognition for his work<br /><br />here is his post:<br /><br />Hi everybody,<br /><br />finally I can announce you that the synchronizer between emesene 1 and<br />2 is quite ready and safety :) At the moment this tool only import all<br />conversations and your personal avatars from emesene1 (one time only,<br />supposing that you'll use emesene 2 after its installation ;) )...<br />The remaining features to implement are:<br /><br />1. Import all avatars of other contacts<br /><br />2. Import all emoticons saved in emesene1<br /><br />We're also still working to make it faster even with huge databases...<br /><br />If you want to contribute, please have a look to files in e3/synch and<br />the SyncTool in gui/gtkui that uses an EmeseneSync object...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
