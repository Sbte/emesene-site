it seems that MS has changed another thing on the protocol that made some of you to have problems authenticating on emesene 1, I applied a patch made by Giuseppe Bagnato and changed the hosts to authenticate to the same as emesene 2. That should fix the problems, please do svn up on trunk and tell me if you sill have problems.<br /><br />Giuseppe Bagnato also added support for proxy authentication, thanks to him!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
