( when someone gets online and someone sends you a message )</pre> currently i'm working in the 0.0.5 release, it will have minor features like enable/disable the sound but in the inside it  will have a redesign to allow easier understanding on how emesene work for those who want to take a look at the code and will make my life easier :P.
