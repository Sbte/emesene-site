Tomorrow I have a final exam so this weekend I was pretty busy, I made some small changes on emesene.<br /><br /><ul><li>I added back the "View information" entry to the contact menu, that allows to see log information about the contact that was selected like status, nick, message and chat history. Still needs some work but it's a start</li><li>now the output of the Contact Information window is obtained from the extension module, so you can change the widget to show the chat history</li><li>moved the status button at the side of the password field to make it easy to move from the user to the password field pressing only one tab</li><li>now the emotes are added as text to the input on the conversation when they are selected from the emote window on the toolbar, also the input widget gains the focus back after the emote is added</li></ul>just some small fixes that were needed, I hope next week I can resume my work on mesinyer.<br /><br />some small quirk that you would like to report? leave a comment.
