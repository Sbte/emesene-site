I think I never mentioned where to report bugs, problems or request features.<br /><br />we are using the issue tracker of github:<br /><br /><a href="http://github.com/emesene/emesene/issues">http://github.com/emesene/emesene/issues </a><br /><br />please check that your issue isn't already reported by someone else.<br /><br />if you want to help us you could try to solve some of the issues.
