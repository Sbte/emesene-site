Well, this weekend I've worked on notifications, sounds and preference dialog, I almost finished the implementation of all of them, still some polishing to do but the 3 work only with some glitches. I also wrote some code to handle blocked and removed contacts on the contact list, but I've not tested it too much. <br /><br />NOTE: on ubuntu 8.10 I have a gui lock when the account has too many contacts, but not on debian lenny, if you test emesene 2 (after doing svn up :D) please comment saying OS version, gtk version and if the gui locks or not (I think it's a gtk bug but I'm not shure)<br /><br />this time I made a screencast to show quickly the state of emesene 2:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJmotTH-WRo&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iJmotTH-WRo&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
