This post will explain a little about what emesene 2 is all about, what e3 is and what is the relation with amsn 2.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The status of emesene 2 (at December 31 2008):</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9lxQhO8I/AAAAAAAAF_E/d4W4V9o1b1U/s1600-h/emesene2-login.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 235px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9lxQhO8I/AAAAAAAAF_E/d4W4V9o1b1U/s400/emesene2-login.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5286027044224842690" border="0" /></a>Login window with auto completion and remember settings.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9mCyUA6I/AAAAAAAAF_M/rWH1XDZnrbQ/s1600-h/emesene2-main.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9mCyUA6I/AAAAAAAAF_M/rWH1XDZnrbQ/s400/emesene2-main.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5286027048929985442" border="0" /></a>The main window with a simpler and nicer layout.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9mE-oHiI/AAAAAAAAF_U/ut_LpGhVwtM/s1600-h/emesene2-main-search.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 242px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9mE-oHiI/AAAAAAAAF_U/ut_LpGhVwtM/s400/emesene2-main-search.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5286027049518505506" border="0" /></a>main window with search enabled (pressing ctrl+F or pressing the search button)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9lzNRYZI/AAAAAAAAF-8/RRLJIJYeaJs/s1600-h/emesene2-conv.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 313px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SVu9lzNRYZI/AAAAAAAAF-8/RRLJIJYeaJs/s400/emesene2-conv.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5286027044748091794" border="0" /></a><br />The conversation window with conversation theme and emoticon support.<br /><br />it's in early alpha development, so no bug reports yet, no crying and only use it if you are an extreme sport fan :P<br /><br />There are still a lot of things to do, I expect to release a usable alpha or beta on the first days of February.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why I'm developing emesene 2?</span><br /><br />I had a lot of ideas about how the next version should be, and amsn2 had an architecture already defined, a MSN library already defined and other things that didn't led me try new ideas, so I started emesene 2 to test this ideas. (read more on the "what about amsn2?" part).<br /><br /> For instance, now the gui is really separated from the protocol library, and the protocol api is well defined so I can work on jabber support on the future.<br /><br />All the protocol stuff runs on different threads, so the main thread only works on GUI stuff, so no more GUI freezing :)<br /><br />The code is well structured, documented and validated using pylint and following the PEP-8 guidelines, also I will post some documentation for starters on this page to help people know where to start.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">what about e3?</span><br /><br />since I coded emesenelib I wanted to rewrite it from scratch, I thought the design of e3 a long time ago, and the idea was to make it multithreaded and with a clean API. I think I'm getting there right now and I'm happy with it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">what about amsn2?</span><br /><br />Since the beginning our commitment was to provide a GTK gui, so all the gui code on emesene 2 is separated from the logic. That means that they can take the code of the GUI and with minimal cleanup have a complete GTK frontend for amsn2.<br /><br />I also coded other modules with reusability in mind, like the theme, configuration and xml parsers, so if they find it useful, they can take it and use it (it's GPL code :D).<br /><br />that's all for now, I will keep posting when new things come. The next post will be about the structure of the code.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
