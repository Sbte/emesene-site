if you tested emesene 2 and you have some small requests to make (no p2p and big stuff like that)<br /><br />post a comment, I will try to implement them.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm talking about emesene <span style="font-weight: bold;">2</span> features, not emesene 1. Also things that could be implemented as plugins are outside the scope by now since I have to finish the core first :).
