if you tested emesene 2 and you have some small requests to make (no p2p and big stuff like that)<br /><br />post a comment, I will try to implement them.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm talking about emesene <span style="font-weight: bold;">2</span> features, not emesene 1. Also things that could be implemented as plugins are outside the scope by now since I have to finish the core first :).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-7085255688477101";
/* 336x280, creado 19/04/09 */
google_ad_slot = "4169844387";
google_ad_width = 336;
google_ad_height = 280;
