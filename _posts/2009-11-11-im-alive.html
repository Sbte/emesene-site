so, lot of time since my last post, pretty busy right now, but I will have more time in the next weeks/months.<br /><br />today I fixed some annoyances on emesene 2 related to webkit errors, the contact list not having ellipsize support and a lot of notifications when using the jabber backend.<br /><br />but this post isn't to talk about those fixes (despite the fact that they are useful :D)<br /><br />I created a new project separated from emesene 2 (that will be used by it) to handle the famous and now defacto standard to define conversation themes: adium themes.<br /><br />this project is separated since it could be useful for other projects like amsn2 or someone who would like to create something like gwibber.<br /><br />the project was created a moment ago and it doesn't have code, but if you want to help us then it will :D.<br /><br />the first thing to do is to read the adium documentation on themes: <br /><br /><a href="http://trac.adium.im/wiki/CreatingMessageStyles">http://trac.adium.im/wiki/CreatingMessageStyles</a><br /><br />and then download some themes and see how they are structured.<br /><br />the idea is to make a module to load/download/validate adium themes and another to allow using them on webkit.<br /><br />if you want to help, start reading and join the emesene mailing list so we can define the structure and other stuff.
