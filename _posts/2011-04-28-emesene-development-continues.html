<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2635/avcall.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/2635/avcall.png" width="500" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">me (c10ud) calling my friend (Homer) from my Ubuntu box</td></tr></tbody></table>That's it, i got this (for those wondering: <b>audio/video calls</b>) sort of working. Of course this is not in emesene-2.11.4 for obvious reasons, but i enabled the thing in <b>latest git HEAD</b> (if you're using emesene from git, you know what i'm talking about).<br /><br />Before you start crying and celebrating, <i>here's some things you may need to know (quot.)</i>:<br /><br /><br />-<b> only receiving is supported</b> (so if you start a call, you'll only see (hear) the other party)<br /><br />- <b>tested only in local LAN with latest Windows XP's Live Messenger</b> (so no strange network configurations or NATs or strange clients or whatever)<br /><br />- will only work with papyon&gt;=0.5.5, python-gstreamer and where X11 is available (due to the use of XIDs, not sure how to do this in other platforms)<br /><br />- we (<i>as emesene-team</i>) are <b>not</b> interested in this feature, so we are not really pushing it, <b>just showing users it's possible to do it</b>. If you think you can complete/fix it, <i>just do it </i>and everyone will be happy (and we will integrate your fixes in emesene, of course!). Basic receiving seems to be working, efforts must be concentrated in the gstreamer part of sending audio/video and a nice gui around webcam/microphone configuration.<br /><br />Everyone not interested, just have fun with the great <i>2.11.4</i> release! (HINT: Official stable PPA coming soon for non-natty users!)<br /><br />I'll close this post with a quotation from the great book of emesene:<br /><br /><i>"..and then thee'll have audio/video calls,</i><br /><i>&nbsp; but thou shalt not annoy thy developers."</i><br /><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; -- c10ud, the book of emesene 2:11-5</i>
