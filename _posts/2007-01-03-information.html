i made important modifications to Msnp13 library to allow users in multiple groups<br />make the code simpler and make it easy to mantain, also i have in mind jabber support in a future (after file transfers, custom emoticons and display pictures :) )<br />so the svn code is a little unstable please keep older versions if you want something<br />more or less stable and wait until tomorrow to make a svn up, if you are a<br />extreme user update and help me fix the posible new bugs :P.
