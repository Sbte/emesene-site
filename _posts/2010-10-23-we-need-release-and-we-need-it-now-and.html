with some time to use on my projects I decided to give emesene 2 a renewed push to try to make it deserve the label of beta.<br /><br />I started fixing issues, closing duplicated, confusing or out of date issues and I only was left with feature requests and papyon bugs. That means two things:<br /><br /><ul><li>emesene 2 is pretty stable</li><li> and/or nobody is using it</li></ul>that means that we need users using it and since emesene 1.x is in maintainance only mode, we need to start moving users and developers to emesene 2. This means that you, your friends and your cat should be using/testing/developing emesene 2. I think that if we don't make the transition to emesene 2 both emesene 1 and 2 will stall and go the way of the dodo.<br /><br /><br />this is a call for action, start spreading the word, looking for users/testers/developers/packagers<br /><br /><br />we need all of those and more important we need developers and packagers to get to the release of emesene 2.<br /><br /><br />at this point emesene 2 is at feature parity with what was the emesene 1.0 release and it is more customizable, extensible and stable than emesene 1.0 was on the release date.<br /><br />what I'm trying to say? if we keep waiting for emesene 2 to pass the features of emesene 1.6.3 we will never make a release. It's time to focus on the core features and stabilize. Later with a stable release people will start to help with fixes, plugins and extensions but a forever alpha doesn't help nobody.<br /><br />since yesterday was <a href="http://capslockday.com/">capslock day</a> I will say it like it deserves to be said<br /><br />WE NEED HELP NOW!<br /><br />start working on making emesene 2 the most awesome IM client on earth now!<br /><br />here is a picture of a panda to motivate you, if this doesn't help I don't know what will...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/01/02/science/03cute.large1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/01/02/science/03cute.large1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
