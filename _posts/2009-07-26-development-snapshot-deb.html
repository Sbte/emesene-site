Juan Carlos Ojeda sent me a .deb of the Jul 15th snapshot of emesene 2 for all te people that want to test it without even waiting for the first alpha :D<br /><br />emesene 2 packages, dependencies Python, Python-GTK<br />915,3 KiB (937306 bytes)<br /><br />   * Can be installed in parallel with emesene 1.x<br />   * Can be installed on debian, ubuntu and debian based<br />   * It installs on /usr/share/emesene2/ and created a launcher on /usr/bin/emesene2.sh<br /><br />can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="http://tecnicoslinux.com.ar/livecd/emesene2_0.0.1a_all.deb">http://tecnicoslinux.com.ar/livecd/emesene2_0.0.1a_all.deb</a><br /><br />thanks to Juan Carlos Ojeda!<br /><br />PS: it's a development status, it's not even an alpha release but it may be useful if you want to test it without installing strange stuff like git-core :D<br /><br />if you find some bugs report it here but expect some delay since this week is final exam week (that's why the development of emesene 2 was so quiet last 2 weeks)
