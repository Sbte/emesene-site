itunes needs a "currently playing" plugin<br /><br />let's do this, I give you almost the complete recipe, you build it as a plugin and everyone is happy<br /><br />on the shell:<br /><br /><pre>sudo pip install appscript<br />python<br /></pre><br />now on the python shell:<br /><br /><pre>>>> import appscript<br />>>> itunes = appscript.app('iTunes')<br />>>> current_track = itunes.current_track<br />>>> current_track.name.get()<br />u'Temporary Like Achilles'<br />>>> current_track.artist.get()<br />u'Bob Dylan'<br />>>> current_track.album.get()<br />u'Blonde on Blonde'<br /></pre><br />now fetch emesene's code, see how the other "current playing" plugins are made, create the itunes version and send us a pull request!
