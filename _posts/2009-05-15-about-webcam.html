some comments suggest that webcam is the only feature that matters, that it's not that hard to get it working, some suggest to use other implementations that doesn't support the MSN protocol.<br /><br />First of all,  if I implement webcam I will use farsight/farsight 2, I won't reinvent the wheel.<br /> About using other libraries/techniques that doesn't support MSN protocol, that makes no sense, the number of emesene users is *really* small, and I think that you want to use the webcam with your WLM contacts, if your friend uses emesene, then easily you could use another protocol/client to communicate, I wont make a emesene only implementation.<br /> Another thing that people don't seem to see is that webcam is really platform specific, linux has troubles detecting and making webcams work, there are a lot of ways to get/display video and sound, so it's not easy, also it works differently for each operating system and even between different versions. The protocol for webcam is closed, the codecs are closed and the specification changes whenerver micrsoft wants to change them, so "it works for me" is not enough here, it must be a good implementation otherwise the users will make a DDOS against the bug traking system to notify the developers that with X, Y and Z webcam doesn't works.<br /> Last (for now) is that I don't have webcam/mic on any of my computers :)<br /><br />and just to show an example on how easy is to make webcam work, talk to the pidgin team ;)
