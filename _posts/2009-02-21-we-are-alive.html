It may seem that the development of emesene 2 is a little staled, that may be because february is a busy month for me, but under the hood there is some movement. :D<br /><br />we have mailing lists now!<br /><br />http://lists.emesene.org/ there are 3 mailing lists, I recommend almost all of you to suscribe to emesene if you want, dev is for developers or people who want to contribute code, that means that you already know python, if you want to start to learn, then ask on the emesene mailing list.<br /><br />We have been discussing the extension/plugin architecture for emesene 2, we want to make almost all stuff on emesene 2 to be an extension that can be replaced by others. That would mean that if you don't like the current menu, the user panel, the contact list, the conversation window or any item inside it you can create an extension, register it and your component will replace the default component (selecting it on the preference dialog).<br /> We want to have this well defined so we don't change the api and the extensions/components don't need to be patched .<br /> It also means that you wont need to send patches to us in order to make a change, you just copy a component, make your changes and register it/distribute it under a different name.<br /><br />that is our idea, now we must make it right :)
