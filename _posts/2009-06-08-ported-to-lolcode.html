can I haz emesene2?<br /><br />no really, we didn't ported the code to <a href="http://lolcode.com/">lolcode</a><br /><br />I didn't knew what to put on the title :D<br /><br />So, here is my sunday update.<br /><br />This time I coded 4 things that were needed<br /><br /><ul><li>Theme handling (sound, emotes, images)<br /></li><li>Theme selection on preferences</li><li>Disconnect support</li><li>Contact added you dialog (with support to reject an invite and not see it anymore)<br /></li></ul>Not too much explanation needed there, now you can create themes for emesene2 and select them on the preference dialog. You can disconnect and login again with a different account. Finally the most important to me is the dialog to add/reject invites from other contacts, now with the option to reject an invite and not see it anymore.<br /><br />all of this needs some testing/polishing but it's almost complete.<br /><br />Finally, I added a retro theme, for the fanatics of the icons from emesene 1 :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/Six-064EVyI/AAAAAAAAGOA/5L39mQtUU5w/s1600-h/emesene-retro.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 274px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/Six-064EVyI/AAAAAAAAGOA/5L39mQtUU5w/s320/emesene-retro.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5344786305404655394" border="0" /></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
