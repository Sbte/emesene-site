hi, this is a little off topic, but I want to announce my new project here because there are some of you who like to code in python.<br /><br />my new project is a small python library (or framework if you like it more buzzword compliant) to make it easy to build REST APIs and websites based on REST (what some people call web 2.0 or ajax...)<br /><br />the page is self hosted here:<br /><a href="http://a-series-of-tubes.appspot.com/"><br />http://a-series-of-tubes.appspot.com/</a><br /><br />I hope you like it :)
