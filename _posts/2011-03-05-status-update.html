hi!<br />just a post to inform some updates:<br /><br /><ul><li>emesene 2 developments continues, slower than we would like to since we are lacking developers (help us!)</li><li> emesene 2 was accepted in the next releases of debian (sid) and ubuntu (11.04) those are awesome news, but we need to speed up development so we have the best client when those distributions release</li><li>we are talking with "cloud" (our benevolent dictator for some time* TM) on consolidating all the sites and interaction around this blog and github (you can see a teaser now)</li><li>I started doing small changes to make emesene 2 as forward compatible with python 3 as we can to ease the migration when the time comes</li></ul>just a reminder, don't report bugs on the comments, use gihub for that (look at the links at the right column) <br /><br />* "some time" is defined by cloud
