sadly, this month has been pretty quiet for the project <br /><br />but not completely quiet thanks to some new developers that are starting to code for emesene 2 and helping us improve it.<br /><br />thanks to Andrea Stagi, j0hn and sbte for their help!<br /><br />this shows that people can start helping with small improvements and move to more complex ones once they get used to the code.<br /><br />what are you waiting?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
