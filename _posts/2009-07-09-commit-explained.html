Ok, first the good news, I implemented selecting date range to view the conversation history and moved the export code to an extension, that means that anyone can implement and extension, register and select it and emesene 2 will use that extension to save the conversation history. Thanks Orfeo C for the idea.<br />The posibilities are endless, the most simple ones are export to different formats, more complex ones are extensions to migrate to other databases, publish the history to blogs or things like that :)<br /><br />Now the experimental part of this blog.<br /><br />Since I'm using git on github to code since a week I started checking some features, this time I decided to comment the changes on the commit I made today so people can read the commit diff an read comments about why I made those changes.<br /><br />To read the commit explanation go to <a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene/commit/fdd8bbd35d3f8ba46eb4ebb0b9393b6e4fd4b75f">http://github.com/marianoguerra/emesene/commit/fdd8bbd35d3f8ba46eb4ebb0b9393b6e4fd4b75f</a> and scroll down a little.<br />You will find labels with a "1" or a number on them if you click them you will see a comment explaining why I made that change.<br /><br />I hope this is useful for some of you that want to read the code and don't know where to start.<br /><br />and as on any post, something graphical to show the commit advance:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SlZcvIGPjZI/AAAAAAAAGug/-wB_iI7WBrI/s1600-h/mesinyer-history.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SlZcvIGPjZI/AAAAAAAAGug/-wB_iI7WBrI/s320/mesinyer-history.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5356570771501059474" border="0" /></a>
