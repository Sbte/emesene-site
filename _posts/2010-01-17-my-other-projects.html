here is a list of my other projects, maybe you may find some of them useful:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">efene</span>: <a href="http://marianoguerra.com.ar/efene">website</a>, <a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/efene">code</a>, <a href="http://efene.tumblr.com">blog</a><br /> efene is a programming language with a C-like syntax for the erlang virtual machine, I created it to make it easier for people to go from "traditional" languages to erlang (BTW erlang rules :P)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">tubes</span>: <a href="http://a-series-of-tubes.appspot.com/">website</a>, <a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/tubes">code</a><br /> a really small framework to create websites and REST APIs without to much code, it takes the repetitive code out, it also contains some code to generate repetitive js code for the models and the REST APIS, and to test the APIs.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">travlr.in</span>: <a href="http://travlr.in">website</a><br /> a site that is like a wikipedia for cool places, you create a "spot" put information about it, add events, comments, associate links, images, videos. The idea is to go there to search for cool places around you whether you are on a new place or just want to look for interesting stuff around you. It can be also be used to search for more common stuff like shops, pharmacies etc.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">webless</span>: <a href="http://github.com/marianoguerra/webless">code</a>, <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/SwcXO3B63kI/AAAAAAAAG1M/GLbzxkuTFcU/s1600/webless2.png">screenshot</a><br /> a really small project that I had based on an idea about doing server side rendering and filtering using jquery, basically you put an url, and write some javascript (you can use jquery and json2.js libraries) you can modify the site with javascript as you wish, the result is returned to you. If you find the "mashup" useful you can save it and you have an URL to load the content. Imagine extracting the weather, currency, or headlines from a site to be used by another or some stuff like that.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">repiola</span>: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repiola">website and code</a><br /> repiola is a small desktop and mobile app to make programs with an assembly style syntax that draw in a surface, I made it to play with something on my phone while waiting for something.<br /><br />if you find some of it useful, want to report bugs or something like that, just contact me luismarianoguerra in gmail.
