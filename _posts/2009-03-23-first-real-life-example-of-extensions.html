My next work is to add support for those.<br /><br />* we are focused on being a MSN client but if someone wants to; he can make his own extension to support another protocol, that won't hurt anybody since it's not part of emesene.<br /><br />** the extension framework is being developed so it's not yet stable.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
