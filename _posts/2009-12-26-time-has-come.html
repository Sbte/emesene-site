to start coding for emesene 2 again.<br /><br />now with less responsibilities and some free time I will start to code again. Today I started adding support for storing and retrieving nick and personal message from/to the server so those are retrieved no matter where you are.<br /> I fixed the bug that didn't changed the status on login, a bug that didn't remembered the nick/pm when the main windows was redrawn and some other small bugs, I also merged with c10ud's repo.<br /> Finally I made the code work on python 2.5 since that is the default on debian squeeze.<br /><br />I you find some annoying bugs let me know, I will try to fix them ASAP.
