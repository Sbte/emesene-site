hi, back from some busy months, I just wanted to show you how awesome extensions are, for that I built an extension to make the input box in the conversation window as minimal as it can be.<br /><br />This shows how customizable emesene can be and how easy is to modify any part of emesene with an extension.<br /><br />less talk more screenshots:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/TJA5O2zvz9I/AAAAAAAAHYA/VyHu_ToVXjI/s1600/minimal.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XkKIWh0VZYk/TJA5O2zvz9I/AAAAAAAAHYA/VyHu_ToVXjI/s320/minimal.png" /></a></div><br />as you can see I changed the config to hide all stuff that was in the way to get a minimal look and feel.<br /><br />how hard was it to add a new input box extension?<br /><br />48 lines of code<br /><br />yep, that easy.<br /><br />now go and tell your friends that emesene 2 is developer friendly and help us make the most awesome, good looking, customizable and extensible IM client on earth!
