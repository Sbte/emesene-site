<span style="font-weight: bold;">about emesene 1.x:</span><br /><br />the development of this version was pretty low the last months mainly because it's hard to maintain (the code is a mess in some places) and there are no developers willing to help to close bugs (if you want, please help us!).<br /><br />the last days dx was trying to close some anoying bugs, he is still on it and I think it will make emesene 1.x better to use.<br /><br />I had little to no time in the last months, so the time I had, was to code for emesene 2 (read below), this month I will have time to advance on emesene 2, so expect some updates about it in the next weeks.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">about the new version:</span><br /><br />I will make individual posts about the new version (code name mesinyer), but let's say that it's a full rewrite applying all the things that I learned over the development of emesene 1 and trying to do a stable, mantainable and extendable code base. The code is pretty alpha but usable, I expect to do some alpha releases on the next month.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><script type="text/javascript"><!--
