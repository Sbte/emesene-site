I made the last post on this site a year and a half ago, and I'm still getting comments and mails that come from this site. That means that people still get to this site instead of the official site.<br /><br />I started a blog on the other site that never took off, it seems that people didn't knew about it or something.<br /><br />and since the forum and the blog were hacked some days ago because of a bug on the forum, I decided to start using this site again to keep posting about the project status, python coding, emesene coding, e3 coding and some random stuff.<br /><br />as always I expect your comments.
