<h1>emesene 2 needs YOU!</h1>
    <p>The emesene team is trying to bring the awesomeness to a new level
   but we're short on manpower so we need your help to deliver a new
   version of your favourite im-application! (which is now not limited
   only to msn but also supports GTalk, Facebook and any other 
   service you may want to implement through our nice extensions system!)</p>

    <p>Want to help? Here's a couple of things we currently need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, developers, developers!</li>
<li>Testers, <a href="http://emesene-msn.blogspot.com/2010/10/instructions-for-testers.html">see here</a></li>
<li>Packagers! (GNU/Linux, Windows, OSX)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any question, get in touch with forums, mailing lists 
   or GitHub issues! (click the BETA button on top-right of this page)</p>
